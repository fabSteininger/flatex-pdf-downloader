# Flatex PDF Clicker (Firefox)

**Download all open entries in the Flatex Mailbox (Postfach) in one batch**

This extension allows you to quickly and efficiently download all your open documents from the Flatex Mailbox (Postfach) without manually opening each one. It works directly on the Flatex next UI and automates the process, saving time and effort.

## Key Features
- Automatically clicks all open document entries in your Flatex Mailbox.
- Triggers PDF downloads directly, reducing the need to view each document manually.
- Supports both Flatex Austria (`flatex.at`) and Flatex Germany (`flatex.de`) overview pages.
- Displays a visual overlay when all entries have been processed, confirming completion.

## Important Notes
1. **Pop-ups must be enabled** in your browser. Flatex generates temporary pop-ups (`wait.html`) during PDF generation. The extension cannot automatically close these tabs.
2. **PDF download settings** in Flatex should be configured to download PDFs directly instead of opening them in the browser viewer.
3. The last document’s `wait.html` tab may remain open due to browser security restrictions; it may need to be closed manually.
4. You must be logged into your Flatex account for the extension to work correctly.

## Usage Instructions
1. Open the Flatex overview page containing your Mailbox (Postfach).
2. Click the extension toolbar button.
3. Wait a few seconds while the extension automatically clicks all entries and initiates downloads.
4. A confirmation overlay will appear when all documents have been processed.

## Privacy
- The extension does **not store credentials** or personal data.
- It only interacts with the currently open Flatex page to trigger PDF downloads.
